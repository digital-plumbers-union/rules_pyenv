# Pyenv Rules for Bazel

*TODO: Build badges and such*

The pyenv rules integrate [pyenv] with Bazel.

These rules can be used to hermetically download and compile versions of CPython supported by [pyenv]
and [pyenv-win] for the supporting platform.

## Quickstart

Add the following to your `WORKSPACE` file:

``` bzl
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "dpu_rules_pyenv",
    sha256 = "241317102c3dafc958371194ba987706d6a87de8529e8da8935dd84753bba5b1",
    strip_prefix = "rules_pyenv-0.1.2",
    urls = ["https://github.com/digital-plumbers-union/rules_pyenv/archive/v0.1.2.tar.gz"],
)

load("@dpu_rules_pyenv//pyenv:defs.bzl", "pyenv_install")

pyenv_install(
    py2 = "<The version of python2 you want to use for your project>",
    py3 = "<The version of python3 you want to use for your project>",
)
```

## Examples

`rules_pyenv` allows projects to select between hermetic versions of Python controlled by Bazel or non-hermetic versions
of Python managed by a pre-existing installation of [pyenv] or [pyenv-win] on the host machine.

Hermetic use of `pyenv` is the default, simply declare your project's [py_runtime_pair] in your `WORKSPACE` file.

``` bzl
pyenv_install(
    py2 = "2.7.17",
    py3 = "3.8.2",
)
```

Alternatively, your project can have `rules_pyenv` use the host installed version of [pyenv] or [pyenv-win] and the
versions of Python it already manages. This can be useful if you find yourself needing to clean your workspace often
and are spending a lot of time waiting for `pyenv` to compile the declared Python versions.

``` bzl
pyenv_install(
    hermetic = False,
    py2 = "2.7.17",
    py3 = "3.8.2",
)
```

## Caveats

- This thing needs tests
- This thing needs build automation
- This thing hasn't been tried on Windows (yet); hence tests and build automation
- You will probably find bugs. No, you're not crazy, it's just not working right; open an issue (PRs are welcome too)
- Since the native Bazel rules only support CPython your use of `pyenv` is restricted to CPython versions 2 and 3. If
    you want additional support for other Python impl
